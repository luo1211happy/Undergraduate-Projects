Starts with a bang, ends with a fizzle.
Difficulty: Easy Time Spent: 10 Hours or Less The Bottom Line:  Disappointing 
Starts with a bang, ends with a fizzle. The Darkness hooked me with the opening sequence. It had the promise of a great FPS with a supernatural twist. Then things started to get predictable. Very predictable. Halfway through the game I realized:  This is it?!  No real surprises after the Hell visit. The game essentially repeats and repeats. Character movements are jerky. The face off with the Darkness near the end is weak and predictable. The load scenes are too repetitive. To top it off, you keep going over the same territory with different  objectives . That seems to me like a cheap way to lengthen a game that would have otherwise ended hours ago. This was a bargain bin purchase for me. six bucks later I can't really complain. Nevertheless, for someone who doesn't game all that often because of the time I have available for it, this was a big disappointment. Lame.
