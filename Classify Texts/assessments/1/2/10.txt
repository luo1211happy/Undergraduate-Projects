Stop with the negativity and look at this game for what it is...A great paced shooter with amazing story and characters
Difficulty: Just Right Time Spent: 10 to 20 Hours The Bottom Line:  Highly addictive 
Although the game has been changed about a considerable amount from the original, new graphics and gameplay style make it a fun and a addictive game and it stands out from alot games being released now or over the past year. The story is a great played out script with amazing characteristics keeping in touch with the original game with the story, although voice overs have been changed from the first outing. The game plays out nicely too with new features in the game, when without your demon arms the game does seem to play like a normal shooter but when demon arms are out and in full effect the commands and options are in depth. The upgrade system(talent trees) is also a nice addition to the game and with a cool online multi player and a side mode called vendettas which has its own small campaign and hit contract missions leads for the game to have hours of fun and addictive gamplay. Although a short game round about 6hours for the main campaign there is the option to play again and with nice in game achievements and side options you can end up spending a considerable amount of time with this game with difficulty of the game depending on your preference. Over all I would consider this an overall quality game with alot of changes from the first but changes for the better . Gamplay- 8.0 Graphics- 7.5 Depth(commands,in game options, etc, etc)- 8.0 Story- 8.5 Length(Hours played,total length of game)- 8.0 Difficulty- 7.0 My overall score 8.5
