I bought this game out of the bargin bin and low and behold it was actually kinda fun
Difficulty: Easy Time Spent: 10 to 20 Hours The Bottom Line:  Surprisingly good 
Granted I would never have paid full price for this game, but when I initially played it, I didn't even make it out of the first area, before I put it down and said wtf is this crap. About a year later I picked it back and low and behold, I started playing it and it was addictive, I had a ton of fun on it. Granted the game was far to easy, but it was fun and provided more than 4 hours of gametime. The darkness guns were a little overpowered which is why it was a little to easy, you didn't really need to worry about health or ammo as long as shadow were present. All in all it was a good game for the price. About the only thing I'd change is maybe add a few more side quests, limit the darkness powers a little more and I think you'd have a good game. Still worth a shot if you havne't played it.
