Great game, enjoyed it very much.
Difficulty: Just Right Time Spent: 20 to 40 Hours The Bottom Line:  Immersive 
I bought this game again for the PS3 several days ago, finished it today, and it still hasn't lost it's impression on me. Everything from the story to the characters and the gameplay to the beautifully detailed environments completely draws me in each time I play it (the graffiti in the environments was custom-made for this game by real graffiti artists). Although the story is short and may seem cliche to some, Jackie Estacado is a very good protagonist. The way he tells the story through the game's cutscenes just keeps you on edge, waiting to see what happens next until you finally see him get his (well-earned) revenge. You end up actually caring about Jackie and his story. The game lives up to it's name very well: it is a surreal, dark, depressing game with plenty of blood, gore and mutilation to satisfy your inner sadist, complete with the ability to devour human hearts to upgrade your 'darkness powers'. The combat is very satisfying with plenty of firepower at your disposition, and things only get better as your powers get upgraded through continuous acts of cannibalism. The only things I didn't like were that the environments outside of the subway stations tend to feel empty and lifeless, the A.I tends to not be very smart and the game just felt too constricted in some areas, most notably the character interaction and the minute number of extra quests. Despite these minor faults, the Darkness is a fantastic game that I found very hard to put down. It completely immersed me into it's world and at the end of the day, I found it to be very entertaining. (check out the in-game TV stations for more cool extra content)
