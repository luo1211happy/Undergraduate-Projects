A nice improvement from the original
Difficulty: Just Right Time Spent: 10 Hours or Less The Bottom Line:  Surprisingly good 
After playing the first Darkness game on my PS3 a few years back, I really wasn't expecting much out of this game. I thought that the best chance I would have at a better graphical experience would be to get the game on the PC instead of the PS3 this time around. This turned out to be a great choice....this game is quite easy on the eyes. As far as the story goes, it is somewhat shallow, but adequate. Gameplay is satisfying, but gets repetitive since there is only so many ways you can kill people with the darkness abilities. Though, there are plenty more choices as how to go about doing this than the original. Difficulty when set on  normal  is more like easy in my book....I'm not a FPS expert or anything, but it doesn't pose too much of a challenge on the normal difficulty. But most of the time I don't play games on hard because I like to actually enjoy the game and not get bogged down with extreme challenges. So, if you liked the original game as I did, The Darkness 2 is a nice step up from it; but don't expect anything amazing because the novelty of the darkness wears thin after a few hours of playing.
