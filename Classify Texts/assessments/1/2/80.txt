When I found this game it was ?. For a game like this that's one of the best bargains since the orange box. The game is unique. You follow a man called Jackie, its Jackie's 21st birthday and he got a birthday present that he will never forget. THE DARKNESS. The darkness takes its form as two snakes with really sharp teeth and glowing eyes and spines. With the darkness you get 4 unique darkness powers and 4 little darkling's to control. These powers are totally unique and change the gameplay for the better. The 4 types of darkling's you get are. A berserker (this little darkling will jump on enemies and kill them it will also do some heavy work for you like push things out of the way). A gunner (this darkling will shoot at things). A kamikaze (no explanation needed. carries around a big pile of explosives on its back and detonates it when close to enemies). And a light killer (destroys lights and electrocutes enemies) The only fault I have with the darkness is that it is over very quickly (it is longer than most fps of today like call of duty.) The graphics are very good for a game that was made 5 years ago it is better looking than most games made today. Another thing about the graphics is the frame rate not once did I see the frame rate drop. In conclusion the darkness is an enjoyable game that never got the respect it should have an underrated gem.
