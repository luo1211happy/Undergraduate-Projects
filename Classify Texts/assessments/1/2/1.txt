the level of the awsomeness matched is directly proportional to the length of the story
Difficulty: Just Right Time Spent: 10 to 20 Hours The Bottom Line:  Worth playing 
it was amazing the combination between the melee and the guns was very good i just hoped that ammo was more available more often that small thing that follows you are around added more humor to the game but it had a lot of story lines that where unnecessary but it was epic and very gore and the cinema-tics where really good but as i said it needed less movies and more action and the story took a little to warm up and it at least gave us some new ways to kill people made it more entertaining Despite some problems with polish and a story that takes time to develop into something great, The Darkness II ends up as an early treat in the new year. The narrative elements help the pacing considerably,It may not end up being the best shooter of 2012but it could very well be the one that makes you feel the most powerful.
