Hello there GameSpot'ers, Today ill make a short but informative Review on The Darkness for the Xbox 360 and the PS3. Lets get right to it. Story! The storyline is very, very well thought and well executed. i was really sucked into the game from start to end, and few games do that to me. I wont say much about the story itself because i dont want to spoil anything :) But ill tell you this, it is amazing. GamePlay! I found the gameplay very smooth. i did not notice any framerate drops or anything in the game. Gunplay is very satisfying and there is a nice variety of Weapons in the game, and the Demon arms worked super. the different attacks of the demon arms never get boring. Enemy and friendly AI is great. the whole thing runs amazing. Mood! The mood setting in the game is perfect, not much more to say. the lightning and everything is very nicely balanced. Graphics! Awesome graphics, the game is from 2007 but it does not look old in any ways, feels very new and fresh. I did not notice any graphical bugs or errors ever. smooth stuff In conclusion, The Darkness is a game that no Gamer should miss, an extremely positive game experience that is not very expensive these days. buy it and you will not be dissapointed :) I give this game a 9.5 //EnGoBBaz25
