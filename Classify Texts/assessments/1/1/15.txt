An enjoyable small ride, but nothing beyond that.
Difficulty: Easy Time Spent: 10 Hours or Less The Bottom Line:  Rent it first 
It's the equivalent of a B-movie in the videogame world. Yep, plain and simple. You shoots lots of things, decapitate lots of things, eviscerate lots of things, smash, crash, bang bang. The plot is cheesy, but enjoyable, the character are one dimensional, but likable, it's the perfect guide on how to make a so-bad-it's-good scenario. You know, like what games like portal 3 or duke nukem forever tried to do but miserably failed. You can carry 3 guns, and dual wield the 2 smaller ones, then you have your 2 tentacles, to grab/throw (left) and smash(right). With this system you can be creative and have fun for the longevity of the game. But is not what i had in mind when they announced quad-wielding, I don't think the game was designed with the idea of people using the four extremities at once, the pc controls at least. The enemies are generic goons with generic AI, and their variations go as far as melee,ranged or ranged with shield. The standard. And that's it, there's really not much else to say, a linear fps with darkness powers to do gory stuff, a short ride that will be enjoyable while it last. Get it on low price or rent it, it will deliver 2 or 3 days of fun.
