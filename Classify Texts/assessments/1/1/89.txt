Could have been better
Difficulty: Just Right Time Spent: 10 Hours or Less The Bottom Line:  Mixed reactions 
The Darkness has some great features, and also some bad that will get in the way of your enjoyment. The gunplay is solid, but it can feel a bit robotic and lifeless at times, the weird aim assist and movement takes a bit to get used to. Darkness powers are pretty cool, but sometimes controlling them can be a bit too much to handle. I couldn't grasp the way you suddenly get these powers, its presented in a weird way, you're just walking down the street and suddenly here it is, you have it, but nothing actually happened. The thing I didn't like is the walking around the subways and alleys till you stumble across the mission you should play. The map doesn't do the navigation any justice, its a mess and you will be walking around in circles for hours. There are many paths to take yet you cannot figure out where to go to at times. I like the traversing parts ofthe games, but I got stuck and lost here way to often so it brought my enjoyment to a halt. The story is pretty decent, plenty of dialogues/monologues and the voices are great. The game looks good, but it doesn't feel as good. If you like shooters and are looking for something a bit different, then give The Darkness a shot.
