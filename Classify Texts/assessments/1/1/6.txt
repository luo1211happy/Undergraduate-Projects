A fun and gory game.
Difficulty: Just Right Time Spent: 10 to 20 Hours The Bottom Line:  Just plain fun 
The Darkness 2 starts off in a nice restaurant. It then all goes to hell. Hired thugs start shooting and burning up the place, killing innocents and your mafia colleagues. Then you release the Darkness. Graphics: 8/10 The graphics look great and mimics Borderland's graphic style. The requirements are pretty low so if you don't have a great PC, you can set the textures on pretty medium-high with minimal lag. The cartoon like graphics make the game fun to play and interesting to look at. Gameplay: 7/10 It's fun when there's no light. The Darkness constantly reminds you to  Stay away from the LIGHT!  over and over again, making it quite irritating. They're also enemies with large flashlights, making you blind until they are killed or their lights are broken. This would be OK, but like I said, it males you blind. The light pretty much takes away all your vision, making you extremely vulnerable and your Darkness is down. It would be OK if it didn't blind you. The gunplay is fun, and simple, but dual wielding guns can be a pain and a bit confusing. I recommend just using one gun. There are also two different endings, a sad one; yet more action-fun one and a corny fake one. Take your pick. Pros: Fun and violent, great voice acting, graphics are fun to look at and the darkness can be fun to play around with. Cons: Too short, corny ending is boring, dual wielding guns, and light. Overall: The Darkness 2 is just plain fun. Although I would personally stay away from it until the price drops. And,  STAY AWY FROM THE LIGHT!
