The Darkness is a great game. Very good story, nice gameplay, great soundtrack. And considering you can pick this game up for less then $20, this is one to add to your collection immediately. Playing as a demon possessed mobster has never been so fun and immensely satisfying. Consider this a combination of The Crow, Goodfellas, The Sopranos and The Evil Dead. Whether you are blasting away at bad guys with guns, demon powers or summoning darklings to assist you in your quest for vengeance this is a game that creates the motivation to see you through the gates of hell and back. So what's not to like? Graphics are looking a bit dated since this game released almost four years ago. Some of the controls are a bit frustrating on the crawling demon (but very cool to slither up and rip the heart out of an enemy). And multiplayer doesn't have much action but again that's not a surprise considering the age of the game. Go out and get this game, then release your inner demon!
