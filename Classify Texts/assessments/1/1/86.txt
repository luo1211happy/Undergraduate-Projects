Great game but doesn't do the graphic novel any justice.
Difficulty: Just Right Time Spent: 10 to 20 Hours The Bottom Line:  Mixed reactions 
Let's just say that this game alone is worth playing to play the sequel that will be 10 times better and look 20 times better. The game is loosely based off a great comic book, it's in the same universe as the Witchblade comics which inspired the decent Witchblade anime. Presentation: Great story, loosely based of The Darkness comic from Top Cow. The powers are great and it's a good, depressing story about vengeance on conquering one's self. Gameplay: You can bite faces off people, eat their hearts, and then throw their ragdoll corpses. It's fun to shoot people and watch the blood spatter in gritty realism. But you shoot so many lights, it's like playing Splinter Cell. Graphics: The graphics engine is beautiful and realistic which isn't the case for most comic book based games nowadays, even the sequel is cel-shaded. But that's not to say that cel-shaded looks bad. Sound: It's fun to hear the bad guys scream out you with comments like  Show your face, so I can shoot you in the face!  and The Darkness has that kinda voice that freaks you out a little. The sounds of explosions, ribcages being broken into, and hearts being eaten is satisfying and well-done. Lasting Appeal: The multiplayer is unique and fun but barely anyone plays online if at all. But there's collectibles to be had.
