Difficulty: Just Right Time Spent: 10 Hours or Less The Bottom Line:  All it's cracked up to be 
The darkness 2 right off the bat is a great game. Realistically you should play the 1st installment developed by starbreeze in order to get the full story, but if just want to rip someone's spine out of their @$$ (literally) then The Darkness 2 is for you! The game is great because of the progression tree, offering people to upgrade areas that they prefer first, whether it be gunplay, melee, armor or more passive abilities such as a swarm of insects that attack groups of enemies. If you're unsure then just get the demo, but between the engaging and twisted story and the solid co-op, this in no way is a waste of time. The quad wielding is fantastic, offering heavy melee on two fronts plus dual wielding weapons. Quad wield is indeed the way of the future and I hope more games incorporate it as well as this game has. In short; it is a brutal, fun and challenging shooter.
