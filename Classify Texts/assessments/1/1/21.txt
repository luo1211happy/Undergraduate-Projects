Almost Went Into The Darkness (Game Review)
Difficulty: Just Right Time Spent: 20 to 40 Hours The Bottom Line:  Almost, but not quite 
The long awaited The Darkness II from the last one back in 2007. The story line in the game was good, but not perfect, but it does carry on from the first game, which is always a big plus in my books. They have changed the graphics to a comic style and of course lots of killing and bloody mess going on in this game. The game i didn't notice anything wrong with it as for glitches or anything, but does become a bit boring at time because its the same gameplay threw out the game, but you can upgrade Jackie's powers to make them more powerful and that can add to the game a bit, but once seen it's a lot then it's nothing new. I played threw the game 2 times as i did like it and was a engaging story line and very emotional in a few scenes of the game more so f you played the first one then you know why it's very touching and you feel like crying. I never played the online as it never interested me, so i can't comment on that side of the game. It's worth buying or even yet renting the game as you can finish it within a day or two depending if you are trying to find all the hidden stuff within the game.
